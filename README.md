# Recipes
It is developed by Kotlin and used:
* MVVM Architecture
* LiveData
* Contentful Delivery Api
* Koin for DI
* Coroutines for Async Operations
* MockK for Unit test
* Extension functions
* Synthetic properties
* Navigation Component for Fragment Management
* Glide for Image Loading
* Constraint Layout for Views
* Sealed class for ViewState
* Not consider too much on UI mostly focus on architecture and functionality
* The challenge has been developed for about 5 hours because it was my first time to work with Contentful Delivery Api
